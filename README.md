# Discord Bot Starter Code
This repository contains starter code for Discord bots in a variety of programming languages. Most code contains the following files:

- **main**: The entry point for the program which gets the bot token, then creates an instance of the Bot and runs it.
- **bot**: A class with methods for controlling the Discord bot and methods to initialize the slash commands.
- **ping**: An example of a slash command. Usually an event handler for slash commands being created. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to get the basics of a Discord bot running successfully in little time. These basics include:
- Read bot token from a file
- Create instance of the Discord bot
- Create a simple slash command
